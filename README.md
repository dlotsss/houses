# Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project uses the Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset includes detailed information about houses, such as their size, quality, and location. The script preprocesses the data, selects important features, and trains machine learning models to predict the target variable, `SalePrice`.
